# Charles Cornell App
This is a console application to find cropped images within a frame of a MP4/video.

## ðŸ“– Story Time!
I wrote this in response to a challenge issued on November 26, 2022 by pianist, educator, and YouTube creator, [Charles Cornell][cornell_yt].

Cornell basically asks in [a community post][community_post] to find this candid image from a video frame that he found hisself:

![image to find](input\image_to_find.jpg)

This frame will be in a video that he will post later on Youtube, *[How is the Spy Family Soundtrack THIS Good?][spy_family_video]*. Whoever emails him a screenshot first gets Cornell's entire selection of music courses for free ($99 value!). 

**This is begging to be automated by a python program.**

And this program will separate your video into frames and search any image (cropped or not cropped) inside of each frame:
